PyCity Schools Analysis using source code PyCitySchools_starter.ipynb to develop PyCitySchools_analysis.ipynb to display a high-level snapshot of the district's key metrics in a DataFrame.

- This analysis of PyCity Schools looked at the reading & math test scores of 39,170 students in 15 schools in the school district taking into account their school type (District or Charter), total student count, and total school budget.
- This analysis shows that of the 15 schools in the district, Charter schools show higher average reading (83.90) and math (83.47) scores than their District counterparts (80.97 and 76.96, respectively).
- Additionally, in this analysis, Charter school students' overall passing rate (90.4%) is nearly 70% higher than that of District school students (53.7%).
- The analysis also shows that students from medium- and small- sized schools score higher in reading & math, and have much higher passing % in both subjects, than those in large-sized schools.
